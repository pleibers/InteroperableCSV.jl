iCSV â€” Lightweight reader/writer for the iCSV file format

Tools to read and write iCSV files, including the 2DTIMESERIES application profile,
and to convert them to common Julia structures (`DataFrame`, `DimensionalData.DimArray`).

Format overview
- A standard iCSV file begins with a first line like `"# iCSV 1.0 UTF-8"`, then three header
  sections, each introduced by a comment line: `# [METADATA]`, `# [FIELDS]`, `# [DATA]`.
- The 2DTIMESERIES profile begins with `"# iCSV 1.0 UTF-8 2DTIMESERIES"` and, inside the
  `[DATA]` section, groups rows by markers `# [DATE=yyyy-mm-ddTHH:MM:SS]`.
- See `MetaDataSection`, `FieldsSection`, and `Geometry` for header structures.

API overview
- `read` and `write` are the main entry points. See [`read`](@ref), [`write(::ICSVBase, ...)`](@ref),
  [`write(::ICSV2DTimeseries, ...)`](@ref), and [`append_timepoint`](@ref).
- Conversions: [`todataframe`](@ref), [`todimarray`](@ref).

Minimal example
```julia
using iCSV, DataFrames, Dates
md   = MetaDataSection(field_delimiter=",", geometry="POINT(600000 200000)", srid="EPSG:2056")
flds = FieldsSection(fields=["timestamp","a","b"]) 
geom = Geometry(md.geometry, md.srid)
df   = DataFrame(timestamp=[DateTime(2024)], a=[1], b=[2])
f    = ICSVBase(md, flds, geom, df)
write(f, "out.icsv")
g = read("out.icsv")
A = todimarray(g)
```
